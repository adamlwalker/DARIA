// Channel-style reasoning normalization (Gemma 4 / Harmony → <think>).
// The shapes here are real: the Gemma 4 chat template opens thought with
// `<|channel>thought\n` and closes it with `<channel|>`; small quants
// routinely sail past their turn end and re-open the channel, and streaming
// buffers end mid-marker. Each case is a leak we shipped at least once.
