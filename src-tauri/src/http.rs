//! The crate's HTTP identities and client factory.
//!
//! Before this module the same Safari user-agent string was pasted in three
//! files, four `const UA` declarations disagreed on what "UA" meant, and
//! `reqwest::Client::builder()` appeared at 29 call sites — several of them
//! rebuilding a client (and its connection pool) on every single request.
//!
//! Two identities exist ON PURPOSE and must not be merged:
//!
//! * [`BROWSER_UA`] — for fetching public web pages that gate or degrade
//!   content for non-browser agents (search results, article extraction).
//!   Sites serve a different document to `curl/1.0`; presenting a normal
//!   browser is what makes the extractor work at all.
//! * A branded UA (`"DARIA model downloader"`, `"DARIA-Updater"`, …) — for
//!   talking to APIs that WANT to know who is calling: Hugging Face, GitHub
//!   releases, our own endpoints. Rate limits and abuse handling there are
//!   per-client, so identifying honestly is the correct behavior.
//!
//! Picking the wrong one is a real bug in both directions, so each caller
//! still names its identity explicitly — the sharing is of the string and the
//! builder, never of the decision.
